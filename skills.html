        <h1>Skills</h1>

        <p>
            Here you can see a more indepth view of the skills that I possess, where I 
            have used them in the past as well any certificates I have recieved.
        </p>

        <h2>Web Design/Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            My knowledge of CSS and HTML has allowed me to create websites at a high level.
            This knowledge is not just limited to strictly the technical coding aspects of
            HTML and CSS but it brought with it the knowledge of how to design a website
            so that it is easy for the user to navigate, it looks good, but not 
            distracting, how to make parts of the website catch the eye, as well as ways 
            to help your website show up in a search engines. I gained theses skills 
            from both my time at the University of Waterloo where I had a course that
            taught us about website design as well as completing a certificate from freeCodeCamp.com
            in Web design. You cand find my 
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/benkoczwara/responsive-web-design"> Web Design Certicate</a>
            by clicking on the link or navigating to my freeCodeCamp.com profile in the 
            <a href="conatact.html">"Contact Me"</a> page of this
            website. I can use these skills to build websites from scratch, but also to be a consultent
            for people who choose to make there own websites. To see some of the work I have done check
            out the <a href="web.html">"Websites"</a> page of this website.

        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>
            I use GIMP to create my grapic designs and my with it skills are only improving the more 
            and more that I am able to use them to create amazing content. At this point most of my graphic design expierence 
            is through sports. I create edits of players, use team logos to create powerful
            images that catch the eye. Some of these images were then reformatted to be a background
            image to be used for phones and computers. I can also use these graphic design skills
            to enhance your website through things like images on your site, links, logos, and more.
            To see some of my graphic design work check out the <a href="graphicDesign.html">"Graphic Design"</a>
            page of this website.

        <h2>Logo Creation</h2>
        <p>
            When I am creating logos I use a combination of GIMP and Inkscape. I find that this
            combination of programs allows be to not only create and manipulate the logo design with all 
            kinds of different tools at my displosal, but it also allows me to create images that are 
            sharp and can be resized to fit what ever purpose that the logo is being used for. Logo creation
            is an incredbily important creation aspect. A logo goes with your branding and becomes as 
            image that people associate with a business and or service. I pay attention to all the little 
            details that come along with creating a logo so that it fits the brand and will be somehting
            that catches the eye and is memerable to those who see it. If you would like to see some of my logo
            design work, then you can check out the <a href="logoDesign.html">"Logo Design"</a> page of this site.
