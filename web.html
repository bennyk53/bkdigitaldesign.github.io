        <p>
            As mentioned in the Skills page of this website I have experience with working with HTML and CSS to create websites
            as well as an understanding of website design to create a visually pleasing website. I made this website from scratch 
            writing all the HTML, CSS and a few JS files, as well as creating or helping to create the websites below.
        </p>

        <div class="websites">
            <div class="websiteBox">

                <p class="websiteP">
                    I was a consultant on the creation of the Steel Consulting website. I did not write
                    or create the website, but I was involed in the wireframing of the website. Click the 
                    button below to visit the website.<br>

                <img src="img/logoDesign/DugoutVintageLogo.png" class="companyLogo">
                <p class="websiteP">
                    Using PHP, HTML, CSS and a little JS, I built the DugOut Vintage website with my own custom 
                    Wordpress theme. Then created the store with help of Shopify and their Buy Button set up.
                    Check them out they are the best place to get your vintage clothing.<br>
