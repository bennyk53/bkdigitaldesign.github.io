        <h1>Logo Design</h1>

        <p>Below are logos that I have created for businesses of all kinds.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div id="steelConsulting" class="companyAndLogo">
            <img id="steelConsultingLogo" src="img/bigLogo.png" />
            <p>This logo was created for Steel Consulting. Steel Consulting is a consulting company aimed specifically at
                agricultural businesses offering various services to their customers that allow them to grow their business. Steel
                Consulting wanted a logo that had a steel look, as well as a logo that looked strong, timeless,
                modern and up to date. They wanted to convey that they are a company that are up to date with everything that 
                is going on, a strong company that is reliable, and will stand the test of time.
            </p>

        <div id="dugoutVintage" class="companyAndLogo">
            <img id="dugoutVintageLogo" src="img/logoDesign/DugoutVintageLogo.png" />
            <p>Even in the world of vintage clothing there is a need for new technology and design. I worked with Dugout Vintage, a 
                vintage clothing store in London, Ontario, Canada, to produce their new logo. They had a previous logo, but they wanted something new and
                 something that did a better job of reflecting who they were. We worked together
                trying out a large number of different designs and ideas using the colour scheme that they provided until we came to this design.
                This logo allows them to continue to grow with a more flexible, and defining logo while still being connected to the origins of the 
                company and the supporters that they have accumulated over the years.
