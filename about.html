                    <p>I attend the University of Waterloo in Canada from 2014 to 2018. I started off in Computer Science and then in my third
                        year I switch to General Math. Over the 5 years of my degree I was part of the co-op program at Waterloo allowing me to
                        get real world expierences to put the tools I had gained from school into use in the real world to see how they work,
                        as well as grow my toolbox of skills to use in the future. <br> I worked for OpenText as an SQL Developer where I worked
                        to improve and organize the tables stored in the databases in order to better depict the information they hold. Each co-op
                        placement is generally 4 months, so I had 2 placements at the University of Waterloo as a QA analyst. I spent my time creating
                        applications in C# to automate jobs and improve work flow in the office. During my second stint in the same position I was in charge
                        of using SQL to clean up tables on the database and then using C# and those cleaned tables to create an application that would track
                        changes in the tables and send emails to the people that would need to know about the changes. I also worked for the University as an 
                        ISA (Instructional Support Assistant) for a first year computer science course. As an ISA I work with professors to create assignments and tutorial presentations. I would then 
                        run those tutorials, as well as host individual office hours in order to help the students of the course. As well as producing the material
                        I was in charge of creating marking schemes with the help of the professors and then making sure that the assignments were properly marked
                        by the TAs (teaching assistants). <br> I graduated from the university in May of 2019 with a BMath with co-op.

                    <p>
                        I started playing football at a very young age of 10. I played all the way through elementary school, and then continued
                        to play for all four years in highschool. In my last year at University I gained the attention of a number of Canadian
                        Universities in Ontario who recruited me to their respective schools. I chose to attend Waterloo and play for the Waterloo
                        Warriors where, over my five year career, I would start every game as a member of the offensive line. During my time at 
                        Waterloo I would play various positions across the offensive line playing every position at one point or another except for
                        right guard. I had a number of achievements throughout my time as a Warrior. In my rookie year I was named to the OUA All-Rookie
                        team which is the rookie all star team for the conference. After my third year I was selected to attend the USports East West Bowl
                        at the University of Laval as a prospect for for the following years CFL draft. In 2018 I was drafted by the Winnipeg Bluebombers in
                        the eighth round. I spent the 2018 training camp with the Bluebombers before being sent back to play my final year with the Warriors.
                        In my final season as a Warrior I would be named a 1st Team OUA All Star, which is the all star team for the conference. In 2019 I attended
                        training camp with the Bluebombers again, but was released at the end of camp. Not getting picked up by a CFL team for the 2019 season,
                        I was the Assitant Offensive Line Coach for the Warriors. In November I was the 1st overall pick by the Saltillo Dinos in the inaugural
                        Canadian draft for the LFA, the professional American football league in Mexico. In January 2020 I flew down to Mexico where I started
                        as the left guard in five games for the Dinos. The season was then cut short due to COVID-19 and later the CFL 2020 season would also be 
                        cancelled. <br>
                        I remain training to be prepared to play in the CFL or in another league that would offer me a contract.

                        After graduating from university in May of 2019 I had all kinds of jobs. After being released by the Bluebombers I spent three
                        months working for as a landscaper working on all kinds of projects and maintenance for homes and businesses. After
                        that I spent four months wokring as a Software Developer for Systems Logic in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, where I assited
                        in the development of their Android app using C# and Xamarin, as well as making changes to datatables in SQL at customer
                        requests. After those four months is when I went to Mexico to play professional football, and is also the time that I created
                        the logo for Steel Consulting. Upon returning from Mexico I was unemployed due to COVID-19, but during this time I was a 
                        web design consultent for Steel Consulting.

                        Some extra bit of information that will just make you feel like you know me better. I am a big fan of video
                        games and table top games, especially strategy or puzzle games. As much as I love and play football, I also enjoying 
                        playing and watching basketball and golf. I have all kinds of music tastes ranging from old school rock, to rap, to 
                        country and electric. If you are here you are probably looking for coding or design work. I found my love for coding 
                        in highschool. I have grown to love it in all its forms C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JS etc. I began to gain an interest 
                        in graphic design and logo design because I was the guy making funny t-shirts and images for my friends in university. I 
                        wanted to further these skills to improve those things, these skills also work well with website design and are skills
                        that I can take with me anywhere I go in the world while I play football.
